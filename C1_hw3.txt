comment: The computational results agree with the theoretical predictions of order of convergence in both Newton's method and modified Newton's method.
For Newton's method, the theoretical prediction of alpha is 2, and the computed results are also getting closer and closer to 2 as k increases. However, the last computed result is different, and it is 1.2244715213e+00 because now the error in root is 2.2204460493e-16, and the accuracy is lost since this number is too small ( it is close to the smallest double value Matlab can handle).
For modified Newton's method, the theoretical prediction of alpha is 1, and the computed results also become stable around 1, so they agree with each other.
